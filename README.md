## 🧠 About Me

I am a **Research & Development Officer** with a background in **Physics**, **Signal Processing**, and **Communication Systems**.  
My work focuses on **model-based design**, where system requirements are translated into **verifiable, simulation-driven logic models**, particularly for **safety-critical and signal-driven systems**.

I currently work at **Proforce Intelligence Systems**, contributing to analytical modelling and engineering validation using **MATLAB/Simulink**.

## 🔧 Technical Focus

- Signal processing and detection systems  
- Model-Based Design (MATLAB / Simulink)  
- Communication systems (ADS-B, radar, RF systems)  
- Logic design for safety-critical decision systems  
- Timing, synchronisation, and validation logic

## 📌 Featured Project

### 🔹 Dual-Authorisation Command Logic (Simulink)

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/your-repo-name/main/assets/logic-diagram.png" width="600"/>
</p>

A **logic-layer Simulink model** that:

- Converts multiple pulse inputs into Boolean states  
- Detects concurrent authorisation between independent inputs  
- Supports independent override logic  
- Outputs a deterministic Boolean decision signal  

**Representative use case:**  
Eliminating single-point failure in **distributed command authorisation systems**, such as safety-critical or aerospace command validation logic.

> ⚠️ **Scope note:**  
> This repository contains a **conceptual and analytical logic model only**.  
> It is **not** flight-qualified software, cryptographic authentication, or a deployed command system.
