# Simulink Projects Portfolio

A curated collection of **Model-Based Design**, **Signal Processing**, projects developed in **MATLAB/Simulink**.  
This repository serves as a central workspace for exploring, validating, and documenting engineering concepts through simulation-driven design.

### Overview
A Simulink-based testbed developed to investigate **parallel FIR filtering** across multiple independent signal channels using a **single multichannel architecture**.

### Key Features
- Accepts **real audio** and **synthetic test signals**
- Independent channels grouped as a **multichannel signal**
- Symmetric **4-tap FIR low-pass filter**
- Time-domain and frequency-domain visualisation
- Selective playback of individual processed channels

### Engineering Objective
To validate that identical FIR operations can be applied **consistently and efficiently** across parallel signal paths using vectorised multichannel processing in Simulink.

## 📐 Modelling Philosophy

All projects in this repository follow a disciplined structure:

1. Clearly defined **inputs and outputs**
2. Explicit **signal flow and assumptions**
3. Time–frequency validation where applicable
4. Emphasis on **clarity, scalability, and reusability**

This mirrors real-world **defence, aerospace, and communications** development workflows.

## 🚀 Roadmap

- Expand DSP testbeds (filter banks, multirate systems)
- Communications receivers and synchronisation models
- Fault-tolerant logic and validation architectures
- Hardware-aware modelling for SDR deployment
