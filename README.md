### Overview
A Simulink-based testbed developed to investigate **parallel FIR filtering** across multiple independent signal channels using a **single multichannel architecture**.
**Matlab-Simulink will be required to open this file.

### Key Features
- Accepts **real audio** and **synthetic test signals**
- Independent channels grouped as a **multichannel signal**
- Symmetric **4-tap FIR low-pass filter**
- Time-domain and frequency-domain visualisation
- Selective playback of individual processed channels

### Engineering Objective
To validate that identical FIR operations can be applied **consistently and efficiently** across parallel signal paths using vectorised multichannel processing in Simulink.
